                    <p>In 2025, SISU proudly joined Dulwich Founder's Day, our very first offline event. To bring our energy to life, we hosted a fun badminton challenge, where students, parents, and teachers all got to experience the SISU spirit firsthand.</p>
                    <p>At the event, we launched our limited-edition SISU pins and canvas bags, which were warmly received by the community. Our booth quickly became a lively hub, drawing attention not only from students and parents but also from Suzhou Broadcasting Television, who interviewed us on-site.</p>
                    <p>What made the day even more meaningful was our commitment to giving back. We donated 20% of all event proceeds to the school's charity account, supporting community and public welfare projects.</p>

                    <h2>Jinji Lake Charity Walkathon 2025</h2>
                    <p>On October 25, 2025, SISU participated in the Jinji Lake Charity Walkathon, a 16-kilometer journey with five scenic checkpoints. The event was both a physical challenge and a moment to reconnect with nature, promoting wellbeing, community, and active living.</p>
                    <p>At the Walkathon, SISU launched our first co-branded T-shirt and engaged participants with our brand ethos of resilience, confidence, and courage. Most importantly, we committed 20% of all proceeds to Operation Smile, helping children with cleft conditions access life-changing surgeries.</p>
                    <p>By combining sport, lifestyle, and social impact, SISU demonstrated that a brand can inspire not just through products, but through action â€” creating meaningful change, supporting the community, and empowering people to live boldly while making a difference.</p>
